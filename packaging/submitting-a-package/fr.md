# Submitting the Package

This article will walk you through submitting a patch for a package for review and inclusion in the Solus repository.

When contributing patches to Solus, please note that we do not accept the upload of binary files (i.e. `.eopkg`).
All repository packages are built by a dedicated build server, from the source files provided in your patch upload.

At minimum, your patch will include changes for the following:

 * `package.yml`
 * `pspec_*.xml`

If any additional files were required for the build, then you must also include the `files/` directory.
If you are creating a new package, you will also need to include a `Makefile` containing the following text:

```
include ../Makefile.common
```

Lastly, many package builds may result in the generation of an ABI report. These files start with `abi_*` and must also
be included, as they allow simple tracking of changes to symbols and dependencies.

For all patch submissions you must be using the `arcanist` utility to communicate with the [Solus Developer Portal](https://dev.solus-project.com/)

## Setting up Arcanist

In three easy steps, you can set up arcanist for the first time:

``` bash
sudo eopkg it arcanist
arc set-config default https://dev.solus-project.com
arc install-certificate
```

On the third step you will be given a unique link to log into the Developer Portal, to create a `Conduit API Token`. This
token will be used to allow the CLI `arc` utility to communicate with Phabricator.


## Creating the patch

For every file you change or add, you must let git know about them: `git add someFile`

For files that must be removed, you must do so using git: `git rm someFile`

Likewise, for renaming a file, you must do so via git: `git mv someFile someFileName2`

Once you're happy with your change, and you have verified locally that it works by having first built and
installed it, it's time to commit your changes with `git commit`.

Make sure you provide a meaningful summary and a separate body to your commit message. For more information
on suitable commit messages, please check the [tooling central documentation](https://github.com/solus-project/tooling-central/blob/master/README.rst#using-git).

- If you want to link this patch to an issue on the Developer portal, simply mention it in your commit message: `The inclusion of <somepackage> fixes T1234`
- If you need a change to depend on another change, mention it in the commit message too: `Depends on D5`

Now you have your git commit, it's time to send it to us for review. Using the CLI again, simply issue: `arc diff`

A new editor session will open, where you can provide optional details. Note that the default reviewer will be assigned after you submit, so it is not necessary to specify anyone here. Once you're finished, save and exit the editor (`CTRL+O` + `CTRL+X` for nano), and the patch will then be uploaded. You'll be presented with the Differential URL, and a review will happen as soon as possible.

## Updating a patch that needs changes

### Updating files

That's easy. Don't make a new commit, just make any relevant changes to your local tree, adding + removing as
before, but this time run: `git commit --amend`

This will amend your original changes, and you can submit the patch once more with `arc diff`.
A new editor session will open, where you can provide details about the changes you've made between the last
revision and the newly amended one. This comment will help reviewers to see what you've changed, to streamline
the process of getting your patch into Solus.

The web UI will automatically update with the latest patch, without having to create any new tasks. Once accepted, your patch
will be merged, and a build will be issued.

### Updating Task Information

If you forgot information such as a test plan, you can run resolve this by:

1. Running `arc diff --edit`. This will open up an editor session, where you can edit the information.
2. Next, you will see an editor session for providing a message indicating the change, for example "Added a test plan."

After this editor session, the updated patch will be automatically uploaded, the web UI will automatically update, and no new tasks will be created.


## Maintainership

Submission directly to a repository is only possible for maintainers. As a maintainer you may freely push to your package(s) and initiate builds for them, which will be pushed to the unstable repository. You can watch 
builds [here](https://build.solus-project.com/).

Pushing changes is not possible unless you have maintainer access. The same is also true of `make publish`.

To request maintainer rights for a repository, it is expected that some level of contribution/maintenance has already happened by way of testing/patching, and there is reasonable trust demonstrated to "hand the keys" 
over to a repository.

Currently, the request mechanism [contact Ikey on IRC](/articles/contributing/getting-involved/en). It is far easier to grant access to active community members than those unknown to the project.

Finally, note that the management reserve the right to revoke access at any time, in order to preserve project safety and integrity.
